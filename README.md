# NLP Work: Sentiment Classification

This repository contains the files and code for an NLP project focused on sentiment classification of text data. The goal is to classify tweets related to health care reform into different sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

## Files in the Repository

- `sentiment classification.ipynb`: main file
- `train.classes.txt`: File containing the class labels for the training data.
- `train.docs.txt`: File containing the training documents.
- `test.classes.txt`: File containing the class labels for the test data.
- `test.docs.txt`: File containing the test documents.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of tweets. Sentiment analysis is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project involves preprocessing the text data, building a classification model, and evaluating its performance.

## Data Description

### Training Data
- **`train.classes.txt`**: Contains sentiment labels for the training documents. Each line corresponds to the sentiment label of the respective document in `train.docs.txt`.
- **`train.docs.txt`**: Contains the training documents. Each line is a tweet related to health care reform.

### Test Data
- **`test.classes.txt`**: Contains sentiment labels for the test documents. Each line corresponds to the sentiment label of the respective document in `test.docs.txt`.
- **`test.docs.txt`**: Contains the test documents. Each line is a tweet related to health care reform.

## Project Details and Outline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **Removing Stop Words**: Remove common words that do not contribute to sentiment, such as "and", "the", etc.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represent the text as a collection of word counts.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Represent the text by considering the importance of words in the document relative to the entire corpus.

### 3. Model Building
- **Train-Test Split**: Divide the data into training and testing sets if not already done.
- **Model Selection**: Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
- **Training**: Train the model using the training data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model parameters for better performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Evaluate the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### 5. Interpretation and Insights
- **Feature Importance**: Identify the most influential features (words) for each sentiment category.
- **Error Analysis**: Analyze misclassified instances to understand the model's weaknesses.

## Usage

To run the code, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
